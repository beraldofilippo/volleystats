# volleystats

A volley stats material design app in Flutter.  
It uses endpoints served by *sportradar* (https://developer.sportradar.com/).

### Limitations
Many times the API fails with a 403 Forbidden because it's using a sandbox environment which limits the call/second rate.

### TODO
Add other sub screens to the tournament details page.  
Add cached responses for HTTP GETs.
